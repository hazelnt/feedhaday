      <h2>From my heart to yours 💌</h2>
      <p>
      Happy birthday🎂🎂, my one and only wife. I hope that in this new age 1️⃣7️⃣✨, you will become a better person than you were before, and that you will be happy, healthy, and wealthy 🤑💵. You are so cool that you've lived to this age. You are the best person I have ever met because I learned a lot from you like how to be empathetic and sympathetic. You taught me how to think of other people and not be selfish to myself. Because of you, now I know how it feels to be loved and to feel important. Not just that, you make me feel safe and calm when I really lose myself, and you always listen to me when I need to be heard and can't trust anyone. You are the person I can rely on in every situation🤍💙.
      <p> 
     Sayang, you don't know how proud I am to have you as my partner and my best friend forever. I am not a person who can easily write down how I feel and what is in my mind, but I know how to make you feel comfortable (I think). I am sorry if I always make you upset or if you ever feel that I couldn’t understand you(hehe). This is my first relationship no matter with boys or girls you are my first to everything:<b> my first love, my first girlfriend, and my first kiss.</b>
      </p>

      <p>
        I still remember how it felt the night we kissed. It felt like a dream, because it never came to my mind that we would kiss  <b>`(*>﹏<*)′</b>. I was totally confused about what I felt. Am I kissing you because of desire, or just because I feel safe and love you? That night , I could feel that something would happen in the future: either we would become lovers, or complete strangers, or just normal friends who can’t kiss anymore. I prepared myself for every possible thing. But as time went by, we didn’t try to forget it or ignore it  instead, we did it more, every night and every time we could 😜. Now I understand that a kiss is more than human desire; it’s an expression of how deeply you love someone.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am happy with what we are right now 👻, and with everything we’ve been through together all this time. Happy birthday, love, and I will wait for countless birthdays we will celebrate together😝😝  with a big heart and full of love 🩷.
      </p>
